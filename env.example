# Spotify API Configuration
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback

# Note: Client Secret not needed - we use PKCE for security

# Note: Copy this file to .env and add your actual credentials
# 
# IMPORTANT: Spotify Redirect URI Setup
# 1. For development: Use http://localhost:3000/callback (Spotify allows this)
# 2. For production: Must use HTTPS (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/callback)
# 3. Add BOTH URLs to your Spotify app's "Redirect URIs" list
# 4. Make sure the port matches your dev server (3000 by default)

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
